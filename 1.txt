1) Create a python program to convert 3d images into floor plans

Creating a Python program to convert 3D images into floor plans involves several steps, including 3D image processing, point cloud generation, and 2D projection. This process typically requires several libraries and tools. One common approach is to use a combination of OpenCV, Open3D, and possibly some deep learning models for more advanced processing. Here is a high-level outline of the steps involved:

Load and Process the 3D Image: Load the 3D image and convert it into a point cloud.
Segment the Point Cloud: Segment the point cloud to identify walls, floors, and other structural elements.
Project the Point Cloud onto a 2D Plane: Project the segmented point cloud onto a 2D plane to create a floor plan.
Post-process the 2D Projection: Clean up the 2D projection to make it a coherent floor plan.

Dependencies
You need the following libraries:

Open3D: For 3D data processing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the floor plan.

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install open3d numpy matplotlib
